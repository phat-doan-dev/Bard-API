### Multi-language Bard API
For commercial use cases, please refrain from using the unofficial Google Translate package included in bardapi for non-commercial purposes. Instead, kindly visit the official Google Cloud Translation website. Please use it responsibly, taking full responsibility for your actions, as bardapi package does not assume any implicit or explicit liability.

```python
from bardapi import Bard

bard = Bard(token=token, language='chinese (simplified)')
res = bard.get_answer("今天首尔的天气怎么样？")
print(res['content'])
```
or
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
os.environ["_BARD_API_LANG"] = 'chinese (simplified)'
os.environ["_BARD_API_KEY"] = 'xxxxxxxxx'

res = Bard().get_answer("今天首尔的天气怎么样？")
print(res['content'])
```

<br>

### Get image links
```python
from bardapi import Bard
bard = Bard(token='xxxxxxxxx')
res = bard.get_answer("Find me an image of the main entrance of Stanford University.")
res['links'] # Get image links (list)
res['images'] # Get images (set)
```


<br>
    
### ChatBard
Some errors in ChatBard have been fixed. However, it is recommended not to pass the value of the token through input.

```python
from bardapi import ChatBard
    
chat = ChatBard(token=token, language='en')
chat.start()
```
or
```python
from bardapi import ChatBard
import os
os.environ["_BARD_API_KEY"] = 'xxxxxxxxx'   # Requird
os.environ["_BARD_API_LANG"] = Arabic    # Optional, Default to English
os.environ["_BARD_API_TIMEOUT"] = 30     # Optional, Session Timeout
 
chat = ChatBard()
chat.start()
```
or
```python
from bardapi import Bard, SESSION_HEADERS
import os
import requests

token='xxxxxxxxx'
session = requests.Session()
session.headers = SESSION_HEADERS
session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", token) 
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy.example.com:8080',
    'https': 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'
}
    
ChatBard(token=token, session=session, proxies=proxies, timeout=40, language="chinese (simplified)").start()
```

<br>    

### Executing Python code received as a response from Bard
```python
from bardapi import Bard
    
bard = Bard(token="xxxxxxxxx", run_code=True)
bard.get_answer("code a pie chart in python for this data={'blue':25, 'red':30, 'green':30, 'purple':15}")
```

<br>

### Using Bard asynchronously 
Using asynchronous implementation will be efficient when implementing ChatBots or something alone those lines.    
BardAsync is not using requests library instead it is using httpx library and http2 protocol.
    
BardAsync is present in translate_to.core_async.BardAsync
```python
from bardapi import BardAsync 
    
bard = BardAsync(token="xxxxxxxxx")
await bard.get_answer("What is Metaverse?")
```
or
```python
import asyncio
from bardapi import BardAsync
    
bard = BardAsync(token="xxxxxxxxx")
asyncio.run(bard.get_answer("What is Metaverse?"))
```

<br>
    

### Bard which can get Cookies
```python
from bardapi import BardCookies

cookie_dict = {
    "__Secure-1PSID": "xxxxxxxxx",
    "__Secure-1PSIDTS": "xxxxxxxxx",
    # Any cookie values you want to pass session object.
}

bard = BardCookies(cookie_dict=cookie_dict)

print(bard.get_answer("こんにちは"))
```

<br>

### Fix Conversation ID (Fix Context)
BART returns multiple responses as candidate answers. Each of these responses is assigned a conversation_id. While using a reusable session, you can observe that your prompt is stored. However, if you desire consistent answers, you can provide the desired conversation_id as an argument among the returned candidate answers.

- Passing only the `session`: Retains your prompt.
- Passing both `session` and `conversation_id`: Retains your prompt and allows you to receive answers with consistent parameters.

```python
from bardapi import Bard, SESSION_HEADERS
import os
import requests

# Set token
token= 'xxxxxxxxx'

# Set session
session = requests.Session()
session.headers = SESSION_HEADERS
session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", token) 

# Give session and conversation id
bard = Bard(token=token, session=session, conversation_id="c_1f04f704a788e6e4", timeout=30)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

### Translation to Another Programming Language
Please check the translation results in [this folder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/tree/main/translate_to).
- Copy the code of [Core.py](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/17d5e948d4afc535317de3964232ab82fe223521/bardapi/core.py).
- Ask ChatGPT to translate like "Translate to Swift."
- Ask ChatGPT to optimize the code or provide any desired instructions until you're satisfied.<br>
